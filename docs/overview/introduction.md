# agent-deep-toolkit

## What is agent-deep-toolkit?

A portable, cross-agent meta-cognitive toolkit for development workflows. This toolkit provides a unified set of deep-thinking workflows and commands across multiple AI coding agents including Windsurf, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Agent Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Windsurf, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode
- **Meta-Cognitive Workflows**: Deep-thinking patterns for complex development tasks
- **Portable Installation**: Single installer detects and configures all agents
- **Independent Implementations**: Agent-specific implementations while maintaining conceptual consistency
- **Skill-Based Architecture**: Modular design following Agent Skills standard

## Who is it for?

- **Developers** using multiple AI coding agents who want consistent workflows
- **Teams** standardizing on meta-cognitive development patterns
- **AI Agent Users** seeking deeper, more structured thinking tools
- **Engineering Leaders** implementing systematic problem-solving approaches

## Quick Overview

The toolkit installs agent-specific commands:
- **Claude Code**: Skills in `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Windsurf Cascade**: Workflows in `~/.windsurf/workflows/`
- **Cursor**: Commands in `~/.cursor/commands/`
- **OpenCode**: Commands in `~/.opencode/commands/`

Each agent gets the same conceptual capabilities adapted to its native format.
