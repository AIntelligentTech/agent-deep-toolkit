# Deep Search Workflow

This workflow instructs Cascade to perform rigorous, multi-step web research to ensure all solutions are grounded in the most current (December 2025) information.

## 1. Information Strategy

- Before searching, clearly define what needs to be known.
- Break down complex topics into specific, searchable queries.
- Target multiple dimensions: syntax, best practices, security, recent changes/deprecations.

## 2. Multi-Source Execution

- Use `search_web` aggressively with multiple distinct queries.
- Do not stop at the first result. Cross-reference multiple sources.
- Prioritize authoritative sources:
  - Official Documentation
  - GitHub Repositories (issues, discussions, code)
  - RFCs and Standards
  - Reputable Technical Blogs (for patterns/tutorials)

## 3. Temporal Filtering (Dec 2025)

- Explicitly look for content relevant to **December 2025**.
- Check for "latest" versions, recent releases, and "2025" in search terms.
- Discard outdated information (e.g., deprecated APIs, old patterns) unless maintaining legacy systems.

## 4. Contextual Deep Dive

- When a promising source is found, read it thoroughly.
- Look for edge cases, limitations, and "gotchas" in the documentation.
- Verify compatibility with the user's specific stack versions.

## 5. Synthesis & Application

- Summarize findings, highlighting consensus and conflicts.
- Explicitly state *why* a particular approach is chosen based on the research.
- Cite sources to provide evidence for decisions.
