# Estimate Workflow

This workflow instructs Cascade to provide thoughtful, realistic estimates that account for uncertainty and complexity.

## 1. Clarify What's Being Estimated

- Define the work:
  - Specific feature, project, or task.
- Identify what estimate is needed:
  - Effort (person-hours, story points).
  - Duration (calendar time).
  - Resources (people, infrastructure, budget).
- Understand the purpose:
  - Planning, prioritization, commitment, budgeting.

## 2. Break Down the Work

- Decompose into estimable units:
  - Features → tasks → subtasks.
- Aim for tasks small enough to estimate confidently:
  - Generally 1-3 days or less.
- Identify all activities:
  - Design, implementation, testing, documentation.
  - Reviews, meetings, coordination.

## 3. Assess Complexity Factors

For each component, consider:

- **Technical complexity**:
  - Known vs novel technology.
  - Algorithmic difficulty.
  - Integration touchpoints.
- **Uncertainty**:
  - Requirements clarity.
  - Technical unknowns.
  - External dependencies.
- **Risk factors**:
  - Performance requirements.
  - Security considerations.
  - Regulatory constraints.

## 4. Apply Estimation Techniques

### Analogous Estimation
- Compare to similar past work.
- Adjust for differences.

### Three-Point Estimation
- Best case (everything goes right).
- Likely case (realistic expectations).
- Worst case (significant problems).
- Expected = (Best + 4×Likely + Worst) / 6

### T-Shirt Sizing
- Relative sizing for quick comparisons.
- XS, S, M, L, XL.

### Planning Poker
- Team-based estimation for consensus.

## 5. Account for Hidden Work

Add time for:
- Meetings and communication (15-20%).
- Code reviews and rework.
- Testing and bug fixes.
- Documentation.
- Deployment and monitoring setup.
- Learning curves.

## 6. Add Appropriate Buffer

- Low uncertainty: 10-20% buffer.
- Medium uncertainty: 30-50% buffer.
- High uncertainty: 50-100% buffer or spike first.

## 7. Present the Estimate

- Provide a range, not a single number:
  - "Most likely 3-5 days, could extend to 8 days if X."
- State assumptions explicitly.
- Identify risks that could affect the estimate.
- Note dependencies.

## 8. Track and Improve

- Compare estimates to actuals.
- Analyze variances:
  - What was underestimated?
  - What was unexpected?
- Improve estimation over time.
