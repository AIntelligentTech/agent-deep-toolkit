# Compare Workflow

This workflow instructs Cascade to perform rigorous side-by-side analysis, highlighting differences and trade-offs between multiple options or states.

## 1. Define the Comparison Scope

- Identify exactly which artifacts, options, or versions are being compared.
- State the goal: decision support, migration planning, or debugging.
- Define the comparison dimensions (e.g., performance, cost, complexity, maintainability).

## 2. Structural & Differential Analysis (The "Diff")

- For code/files:
  - Identify what has changed, what is new, and what has been removed.
  - Explain the *intent* behind the differences, not just the text changes.
- For architectures/libraries:
  - Map core functionalities side-by-side.
  - Identify unique features and shared capabilities.
  - Note differences in implementation patterns or paradigms.

## 3. Explicit Trade-off Mapping

- Use a structured format (e.g., Pros/Cons, Advantage/Disadvantage) for each option.
- Highlight the **Zero-Sum** aspects:
  - If we gain X (e.g., speed), what are we losing (e.g., memory, simplicity)?
- Identify the "ideal" use case for each option.

## 4. Multi-Dimensional Evaluation

- Create a comparison matrix across key criteria:
  - **Runtime**: Performance, scalability, resource usage.
  - **Development**: Ease of use, learning curve, tooling, ecosystem.
  - **Business**: Cost, licensing, vendor lock-in, time-to-market.
- Assign relative ratings (High/Medium/Low or 1-5) to normalize the comparison.

## 5. Synthesis and Recommendations

- Summarize the fundamental differences.
- Call out "deal-breakers" or critical risks associated with specific options.
- Provide a recommendation based on the user's specific constraints (link to `/decide` for formal decision-making).
