# Brainstorm Workflow

This workflow combines divergent idea generation with structured evaluation, helping teams explore alternatives and prioritize the most promising directions.

## 1. Clarify the Problem Space

- Define what you're brainstorming for:
  - New feature, solution to a problem, process improvement, strategic direction.
- Articulate constraints:
  - Time, budget, technology, team skills, regulatory.
- Distinguish between negotiable and non-negotiable constraints.

## 2. Ground in Current Reality

- Understand the current state:
  - Existing solutions, pain points, user feedback.
- Research current trends:
  - Use `/search` to find relevant patterns, tools, and industry practices.
- Identify what's working and what's not.

## 3. Generate Ideas Broadly (Diverge)

- Aim for quantity over quality initially.
- Use multiple frames to stimulate ideas:
  - **Analogies**: How do other industries solve similar problems?
  - **Extremes**: What if we had unlimited resources? What if we had none?
  - **Inversion**: What would make this problem worse? Now, do the opposite.
  - **User perspectives**: What would different users want?
  - **Technology**: What new capabilities could we leverage?
- Include wild ideas—they often spark practical ones.
- Record all ideas without judgment.

## 4. Evaluate and Refine (Converge)

- Group similar ideas.
- Evaluate against criteria:
  - Value/impact, feasibility, alignment with goals.
  - Risk, reversibility, learning potential.
- Use `/decide` techniques for important decisions:
  - Decision matrix, cost-benefit, pre-mortem.
- Identify ideas worth exploring further.

## 5. Prioritize and Define Next Steps

- Rank top ideas by potential and feasibility.
- For the most promising:
  - Define what would need to be true for this to work.
  - Identify quick experiments or prototypes to validate.
  - Assign ownership and timeline.
- Capture rejected ideas with rationale (they may be useful later).

## 6. Connect to Execution

- Translate selected ideas into:
  - Specs (`/spec`) for detailed design.
  - Implementation plans (`/plan`) for execution.
  - Experiments (`/experiment`) for validation.
- Set up checkpoints to revisit and iterate.
