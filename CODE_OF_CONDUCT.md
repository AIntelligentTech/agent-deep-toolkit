# Code of Conduct

Agent Deep Toolkit is intended to be a collaborative, professional open-source project. All participants are expected to help create a respectful, inclusive environment.

## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and respect for other people.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for users and the community.
- Being considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment, including stalking or sustained disruption.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the issue tracker, pull requests, discussions, and any other project-related communication channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If you observe or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Prefer private reporting over public call-outs for sensitive issues.
- Use the projects official communication channels (for example, GitHub issues or discussions) or any dedicated contact methods published in the repository metadata.

Maintainers will review and respond to reports in good faith, aiming to respect the privacy and safety of all parties.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant and adapted to the needs of this project.
